# SVCurator
SVCurator is a Python flask based web app that allows users to manually curate putative structural variants from the Ashkenazim Jewish Trio son (NIST RM 8391). The web app displays svviz read aligned images and boxplot images as well as IGV images representing over 1200 putative structural variants. For each variant, questions and a comment section were included to describe the size and accuracy of the putative structural variant. 


SVCurator can be accessed here: http://www.svcurator.com/, and registration via Google OAuth is required to access the app.
